# The Stryker4s integration test project

This test project is used to verify that Stryker4s works like expected.
For example integration with `sbt` or `Maven`, the project is also written with a common use case in mind. 
A normal REST API so it will resemble a lot of production applications.

The [Stryker robobar](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/robobar-example) is taken as inspiration to showcase the different between code coverage and mutation score.
The [Scala-pet-store](https://github.com/pauljamescleary/scala-pet-store) is taken as inspiration to code the application in a pure functional scala idom way.
